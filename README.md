# Bhaiya Discord Bot

A Discord bot that scolds users if they mention specific forbidden words. This bot is built using Discord.py, a Python library for creating Discord bots.

## Features

- Monitors messages in Discord servers and sends a scolding message to users who mention forbidden words.
- Supports multiple forbidden word variations.
- Sends a direct message to the user to avoid public embarrassment.
- Handles common command errors and logs disconnections from Discord.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bhaiya-discord-bot.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new bot application.

6. Run the bot using the following command:

   ```shell
